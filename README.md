A very simple Bitcoin merchant solution. 

To get started you need:

MySQL
PHP (v5.X)
Medoo

To get started, create a large number of Bitcoin public and private keys, which can be easily generated here:
www.bitaddress.org

Upload the complete .csv file to a MySQL database table. Keep it secure and offline.
Duplicate the MySQL table, and delete the private keys. This is what you'll upload to your server.
